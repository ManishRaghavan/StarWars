# Star Wars search bar 🔍
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.During the battle, rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon. Rather oddly these plans contain blueprints for a UI component to search for Star Wars characters by name. Perplexed, the Rebel Command decides to build this for themselves.

> So  built this component to help the rebels restore freedom to the galaxy.
